<p><strong><span style="font-size: 5px;">Welcome to Infinite Durability Mod</span></strong></p>

<p>I decided to create this mod after discovering one didn't exist for 1.6.0 yet. I probably spent more time developing the tools used to unpack/repack all the files in bulk but it ended up saving me a bunch of time and I was able to complete this in a few hours. Ill post the tools in the GitHub Repo so IF in the future the files need to be recompiled, you can attempt to do so youself if I can't get around to it quick enough. Anyways, hope you enjoy as much as I do.</p>
